## Introduction
#### My name is Nicole Huynh and I am in 10th grade. My hobbies are playing video games, playing volleyball, and I enjoy exploring activities related to music. I have a dog named Banh Bao which I absolutely love even though he misbehaves. And I love food, most of my friends know me as "the foodie". 

## Fun Fact About Myself
#### A fun fact about myself is that my dad and I have the same birthday (November 10) and my mom and my sister have the same birthday (March 8). 

## Goals for the School Year
#### My goals for this school year are to get all A's and E's, to make many new friends, and to start doing more extracurriculars to help with my college application. 

## Favorite Summer Food
#### My favorite summer food was mangosteen. Mangosteen is a fruit and it's absolutely delicious. I also really enjoy eating spicy fried chicken and other spicy foods. Desserts I enjoyed were a Vietnamese dessert called Che Thai and I also enjoyed eating ice cream. 

## Summer Playlist
#### During summer I listened a lot of music, but the artist that I listened to the most was the Marias. I listened to the Marias the most because I love their music, especially their new album called Submarine. I also enjoyed listening to Chappel Roan. I don't usually listen to Billie Eillish, but her new album was really good. There was a lot of other artists I listened to, but those were some of them.
